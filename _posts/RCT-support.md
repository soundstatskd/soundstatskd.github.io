title: Supporting Randomized Controlled Trials
subtitle: Design and Interim Monitoring
---

Non-inferiority (NI) trial designs require specification of a margin for ruling out excess harm relative to control.  When an active control has been evaluated in prior trials and real world evidence (RWE) studies, the margin may be based upon these estimates, with adjustments for anticipated differences between past and NI trial settings.

Platform trials allow for evalaution of multiple interventions. Comparison to a common control may be most efficient under unequal randomization ratios, with reduced sample sizes.  In this case, the analysis approach should account for randomization probabilities for comparisons to concurrent controls over time.

Interim monitoring of randomized controlled trials may be specified to reduce expected sample size without sacrificing statistical integrity, and an independent statistician on your data safety monitoring board ensures patient safety and scientific integrity.

Sound Statistics consultant, Katherine Davis, has expertise in these aspects of randomized trial designs and monitoring, as well as a network of peers with direct experience in regulatory trials.
