Non-inferiority (NI) trial designs require specification of a margin for ruling out excess harm relative to control.  When an active control has been evaluated in prior trials and real world evidence (RWE) studies, the margin may be based upon these estimates, with adjustments for anticipated differences between past and NI trial settings.

Platform trials allow for evalaution of multiple interventions against a common control. Methods for analysis and randomization ratios may allow for comparison to a common control with a reduced sample size and unequal randomization ratio.

Interim monitoring of randomized controlled trials may be specified to reduce expected sample size without sacrificing statistical integrity, and an independent statistician on your data safety monitoring board ensures patient safety and scientific integrity.
